## Summary
Wayfair is an e-commerce retailer that sells furniture and other home goods. While Wayfair mainly sells to individual consumers, it also has a large B2B (Business-to-Business) division that sells to business customers such as interior design firms, contractors, and hotels.
As a data-driven company, Wayfair ensures that their B2B customers receive best-in-class service by leveraging data science models to predict customer needs and purchasing patterns. Wayfairâ€™s marketing, sales, and operations teams utilize these models to guide business decisions. 

Keeping this in mind, Wayfair hosted a challenge on the ScholarJet website this year for which they released their B2B customer interaction dataset that will be used here. The goal of the challenge was to build a model to predict customer behavior for Wayfair. The goal of our project is to gain insights from the business customer data like customer information,sales call records, purchase history etc. and build predictive models to work on the following problems: 

B2B customer conversion (classification): Whether a B2B customer will purchase or not in the next 30 days
B2B customer expected revenue (regression): How much a B2B customer will spend in the next 30 days
